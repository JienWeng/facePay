4. **Phone Notification** - Simulated iPhone 12 push notification appears
5. **Payment Confirmation** - Click "Confirm" to complete the payment
6. **Success** - Payment completed with transaction ID

### How to Test FaceID:

2. Click the blue "Pay with Face ID" button in the express checkout card
3. Grant camera permission when prompted
4. Click "Start Face Scan"

## Quick Start (Using CDN - Current Setup)

The `index.html` file is currently set up to use Tailwind CSS via CDN, so you can:

1. **Simply open the file in your browser:**
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

2. **Or serve it with a local server:**
   ```bash
   # If you have Python installed
   python3 -m http.server 3001
   
   # Or if you have Node.js installed
   npx live-server --port=3001
   ```

## Professional Setup (Recommended for Production)

For a more professional setup with compiled CSS:

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build Tailwind CSS:**
   ```bash
   npm run build-css
   ```

3. **Update the HTML to use compiled CSS:**
   Replace the CDN script tags in `index.html` with:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="./dist/output.css">
   ```

4. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Current Setup
